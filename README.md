# MMM-FearAndGreedIndex-dv

The `MMM-FearAndGreedIndex-dv` is a module for MagicMirrorÂ² that displays the Fear and Greed Index for both traditional markets and cryptocurrency markets. This index is a measure of market sentiment, with lower values indicating fear and higher values indicating greed.

This fork of the original [MMM-FearAndGreedIndex](https://github.com/Pip1405/MMM-FearAndGreedIndex)
- replaces the Python script `fearandgreed.py` with Node.js `fetch()`
- caches the results of both data sources
- applies color scheme in line with CoinMarketCap's color scheme
